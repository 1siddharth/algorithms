# What is an algorithm?

Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output.

An algorithm should have three important characteristics to be considered valid:

- **It should be finite**: If your algorithm never ends trying to solve the problem
it was designed to solve then it is useless
- **It should have well defined instructions**: Each step of the algorithm has to
be precisely defined; the instructions should be unambiguously specified for each case.
- **It should be effective**: The algorithm should solve the problem it was designed
to solve. And it should be possible to demonstrate that the algorithm converges with
just a paper and pencil.
