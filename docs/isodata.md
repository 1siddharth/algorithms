The Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (**ISODATA**) method used a set of rule-of-thumb procedures that have 
incorporated into an iterative classification algorithm. Many of the steps used in the algorithm are based on the experience obtained through experimentation. The ISODATA algorithm is a modification of the [k-means clustering algorithm](k-means) (overcomes the disadvantages of k-means). This algorithm includes the merging of clusters if their separation distance in multispectral feature space is less than a user-specified value and the rules for splitting a single cluster into two clusters. This method makes a large number of passes through the dataset until specified results are obtained.
