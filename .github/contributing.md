## Contributing

> Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

**General Rules**

[GET STARTED HERE](https://github.com/AllAlgorithms/algorithms/blob/master/.github/category-template/algorithm-template/readme.md) with a template.

<p id="general-rules"></p>

- As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code.

**All ▲lgorithms Structure**

<p id="structure"></p>

> We follow this structure

- Directories and files are all in lower case letter.
- Directories are separated by a minus or hyphen (`-`). In libraries this may change to follow the standards of the programming language
- Files are separated by an underscore (`_`) following the `snake_case` style. This could change to follow style standards on some languages like Java where we are using `CamelCase` style.

**Contributing New Algorithms**

<p id="new"></p>

- Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of contributing "several algorithms" all at once contribute them all one by one separately (i.e. one pull request for "Binary Search", another one
for "Bubble Sort" and so on).
- Describe what you do in code using **comments**.
